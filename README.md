# Movie Tracker 

### Introduction

Movie Tracker is an application built using the [Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) in order to help it's personalized users browse, search for, as well as favorite/unfavorite any movie they come across.

This project was assigned to be completed in less than 5 days requiring communication between myself and two other team members. It was our first time utilizing a back end database and server to store and retrieve information.
